# Cache Map
Cache Map is a simple and user-friendly map application. This application allows you to display locations on a map using the OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.js libraries. It is specifically created for educational purposes.
* Note: I'm working on cross-share encryption and a separate database. Developed with OpenAI.

## Features
* Add Locations: You can add locations by clicking on the map. The latitude and longitude coordinates are automatically populated in the input fields.
* Emoji Selection: Assign emojis to each location. Emojis are displayed in the location list and on the map ( üìç üü¢ üî¥ )
* Location Descriptions: Add descriptions to your locations. Descriptions are shown in the location list and on the map.
* Location Deletion: Easily delete added locations.
* Data Sharing and Import: You can copy the location data and paste it elsewhere. This allows you to transfer or backup the locations to another device.
